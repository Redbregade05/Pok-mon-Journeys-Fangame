# Pok-mon-Journeys-Fangame

This is a pokémon game made with Pokémon Essentials. So the game will contain the key features Gen 8 games have.
Including but not limited to Pokémon, reusable TM's, special/physical split and so on.
And of course: new region, new characters, all the good stuff.

What region is this game based on?
This region is based on the Philippines, an archipelagic state in south-east Asia. 

So whats the deal with fakemon?
We are still deciding what amount of fakemon we want to add to the game. Feel free to leave suggestions in #fakemons, but you have to make sure we can actually use them, without violating copyright.

Can I help?
Yes you can! Let us know in #recruitment what your abilities are.

When when this game be finished?
We don't know. And it's probably for the best to not promise a release date, before we're sure we can finish it to that date.
I think it's in everybody's interest to not have a "Cyberpunk 2077 Catastrophe".

How does this hack relate to Pokémon Journeys?
There are going to be characters from the anime in the game. But which is top secret.
